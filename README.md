# GTC-Heart-Disease-Risk-Prediction

## 📝 Description  
This project aims to build a **machine learning-based prediction model** that helps estimate the risk of heart disease in individuals. The purpose is to support **preventive healthcare** by identifying whether a patient is at **high risk** ⚠️ or **low risk** ✅.  

The system will:  
- 👤 Take in **patient demographics** (e.g., age, gender) and **clinical/lifestyle features** (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking habits).  
- 🤖 Use an ML model to **predict heart disease risk**.  
- 💻 Provide results through a **lightweight frontend**, enabling healthcare professionals and analysts to obtain quick risk estimates for better decision-making and early interventions.
